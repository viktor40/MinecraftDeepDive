# MinecraftDeepDive

A repository documenting the inner workings of minecraft. 
Still very WIP. The documentation will evolve and be expanded while I read the code and am trying to understand it. Everything is still subject to change. Files that are marked with "in progress" at the top won't be accurate since I'm still woring on them.
